# Internship Task 6 - Advanced Statistical and Analytical Methods

## Overview
This directory contains the code and dataset for Task 6 of my internship at MainFlow. The focus of this task was to apply advanced statistical and analytical methods to solve complex problems. The specific responsibilities included implementing time series analysis for forecasting trends and seasonality, performing sentiment analysis or text mining on unstructured data, and exploring clustering or classification techniques for segmentation and pattern recognition.

## Key Learnings
- **Time Series Analysis**:
  - Gained insights into the trends and seasonal patterns in the dataset.
  - Learned to visualize time series data for better understanding and forecasting.

- **Sentiment Analysis and Text Mining**:
  - Applied text mining techniques to unstructured data to extract key information.
  - Performed sentiment analysis to classify the sentiment of descriptions into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

- **Clustering and Classification**:
  - Explored and implemented clustering techniques for data segmentation.
  - Understood the importance of scaling features and handling non-numeric values for effective clustering.
  - Analyzed the clusters to identify patterns and segment the data meaningfully.
