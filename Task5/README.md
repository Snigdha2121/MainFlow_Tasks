# Internship Task 5 - Feature Engineering and Selection

## Overview
This directory contains the code and files for Task 5 of my internship at MainFlow. In this task, the focus was on feature engineering and selecting relevant features for model training. The goal was to enhance predictive accuracy and optimize model performance through effective feature selection techniques.
## Key Learnings
- Gain insights into feature engineering by creating new meaningful features from existing data.
- Learn how to apply techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or feature importance to identify and prioritize significant features.
- Understand the importance of optimizing feature sets to enhance model performance and efficiency.
