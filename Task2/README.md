# Internship Task 2 - Data Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview
This directory contains the code and files for Task 2 of my internship task at MainFlow. In this task, I focused on using the Pandas library to manipulate data from a CSV file. This involved performing operations such as filtering data based on conditions, handling missing values, and calculating summary statistics.

## Key Learnings
- Learned how to load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Developed skills in filtering data based on conditions using Pandas operations.
- Learned techniques for handling missing values, including dropping or imputing missing values.
- Enhanced skills in calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation using Pandas functions.
- Expanded data distribution and variability knowledge through the Interquartile Range (IQR) concept.
