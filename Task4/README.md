# Internship Task 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This directory contains the code and files for Task 4 of my internship at MainFlow. In this task, I focused on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset. The goal was to create visualizations to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and check for correlations between variables.

## Key Learnings
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset through exploratory data analysis techniques.
- Learn how to create visualizations to explore the distribution of variables in the dataset.
- Identify outliers in the dataset and understand their impact on the data analysis.
- Check for correlations between variables to understand relationships within the dataset.
- Enhance data analysis skills using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib.
